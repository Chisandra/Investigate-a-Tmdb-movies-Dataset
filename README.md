# Investigate-a-Tmdb-movies-Dataset
This is an investigation on a Tmdb movies dataset
The dataset contains 10,000 movies collected from the movie Database(TMDb). In this project, we will be analyzing dataset containing information associated with 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

In particular, we will be interested in answering the following questions;

which movies generated the most revenues across the years?
which movies had the most expensive budgets?
which movie genre are the most popular from year to year?
What is the relationship between movie budgets and revenues?
The project was carried out using Jupyter notebook and we have imported certain libraries to help us with this analysis.
